#Real time interactive neural network image manipulation.

##Uses a webcam and face detection as a trigger to modify [Gina Chiao's](http://www.ginachiao.com) paintings in real time with a trained neural network for an art exhibit in Taiwan.

### I am running this in a docker container using caffe, OpenCV 3.1.0, CUDA, cuDNN and Python 2.7.
